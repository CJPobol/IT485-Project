# gf3d
a collection of utlitity functions designed to facilitate creating 3D games with ~~OpenGL~~ Vulkan and SDL2
This project is specifically intended to function as an educational tool for my students taking 3D Game Programming.

Currently the project is in a WIP state.
It represents my first stab at getting vulkan rendering pipeline setup.
It is not stable and I intend to do a complete rewrite of the vulkan system as soon as I can find some time
