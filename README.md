# Description
This project serves as my first attempt creating a 3D game from scratch, without the use of an existing game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine. Starting from minimal seed code provided by Professor DJ Kehoe at NJIT, this project was developed in C from the ground up.
Note: All models used in this game are not my own, they were provided by the professor of this course as 3D modelling was not the intention of this course, or this project.

# Parkour World
This game involves interacting with NPCs and collecting coins to collect all the available items in the game, of which there are 10. These items provide the player with new and powerful movement abilities to help them traverse the world. This early version implements the movement abilities and methods of obtaining them, though the map itself is not at a polished and finished state at the moment.
